Basically, one can wrap a stream/collection with ProgressBar.wrap(...) so that when iterating/reading/writing over it, a progress bar automatically tracks its progress. The type of your collection/stream does not change after wrapped with a progress bar. The collection/stream types supported are: T[] ; java.lang.Iterable<T> ; java.util.Iterator<T> ; java.io.InputStream (can be regarded as an Iterator<Byte> ); java.io.Reader (can be regarded as an Iterator<Char> ); java.io.OutputStream (dual of InputStream ); java.io.Writer (dual of Reader ); java.util.Spliterator<T> ; java.util.Stream<T> (actually any S such that S extends BaseStream<T, S> . When wrapping over a primitive stream, boxing overhead may be incurred). The syntax for the method call is ProgressBar . wrap ( collection , taskName ) Or, if you want to use the builder pattern to customize the progress bar, use ProgressBarBuilder pbb = new ProgressBarBuilder () . setXXX (). setYYY (); // setting the builder ProgressBar . wrap ( iterable , pbb ) Examples: Example 1: Traverses through a Java collection \u00b6 If the size of the collection is known, the progress bar's max will be automatically set as the size of the collection; otherwise the progress bar will be indefinite. for ( T x : ProgressBar . wrap ( collection , \"Traversing\" )) { ... } Example 2: Loops over an integer range \u00b6 Since 0.7.2 , tracking the progress of sequential or parallel Java streams is supported. ProgressBar . wrap ( IntStream . range ( left , right ). parallel (), \"Task\" ). forEach ( i -> { ... }); Example 3: Reads a large file lazily \u00b6 When wrapping around a java.io.InputStream , whether it is a java.io.FileInputStream will be detected. If successful, the file's full size in byte will be retrieved and set as the progress bar's max; otherwise, the progress bar will be indefinite.
